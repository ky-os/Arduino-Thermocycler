# Arduino-Thermocycler

## Program States
The program state of a thermocycler can vary depending on the specific implementation, but here are some common program states:

Idle: The thermocycler is waiting for user input or for the temperature to stabilize before starting the next step.
Running: The thermocycler is currently executing a program step, such as denaturation, annealing, or extension.
Stopped: The thermocycler has completed all program steps and is stopped, awaiting further user input or a power cycle to start a new program.
Error: The thermocycler has encountered an error condition, such as a sensor failure or an over-temperature condition, and cannot continue until the issue is resolved.
There may be additional states depending on the specific features of the thermocycler, such as a pause state, a cooldown state, or a hold state.

## Thermal States
The thermal state of a thermocycler typically refers to the current temperature and thermal conditions of the thermocycler itself, as well as any samples or reagents that are being processed inside it. Some possible thermal states of a thermocycler include:

Heating: The thermocycler is actively raising the temperature of the sample block or chamber to a target setpoint temperature.
Cooling: The thermocycler is actively lowering the temperature of the sample block or chamber to a target setpoint temperature.
Holding: The thermocycler is maintaining the sample block or chamber at a constant target setpoint temperature, without actively heating or cooling it.
Equilibrating: The thermocycler is allowing the temperature to stabilize or equilibrate after a temperature change, before proceeding to the next step.
Error: The thermocycler has encountered an error condition, such as a sensor failure or a temperature overshoot, and is not able to maintain the desired thermal state.
The specific thermal states and temperature ranges used in a thermocycler will depend on the application and the types of samples or reagents being processed.

## Thermocycling Process Steps
Here's a general overview of the steps involved in a typical thermocycling process:

Denaturation: The initial step in many thermocycling protocols involves denaturing or separating the two strands of the DNA or RNA template.
Annealing: After denaturation, the sample is cooled to a temperature that allows the primers to anneal or bind to the template strands.
Extension: Once the primers are annealed to the template, the polymerase enzyme can extend the primers and synthesize new DNA strands.
Repeat: Steps 1-3 are repeated for a number of cycles to amplify the DNA or RNA target sequence exponentially.
Final Extension: After the final amplification cycle, a final extension step is performed to ensure complete synthesis of the DNA strands.
Hold: After the final extension step, the sample is held at a lower temperature to stop the reaction and stabilize the sample until it can be removed from the thermocycler.
The exact temperature and time parameters used in each step may vary depending on the specific protocol and the type of sample being processed. Additionally, some protocols may include additional steps, such as melting curve analysis or additional purification steps, to further characterize or analyze the amplified DNA.
